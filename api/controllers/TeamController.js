/**
 * TeamController
 *
 * @description :: Server-side logic for managing teams
 * @help        :: See http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/Controllers
 *
 * To override a RESTful blueprint route for a single controller, simply create
 * an action in that controller with the appropriate name: find, findOne, create,
 * update, destroy, populate, add or remove.
 * See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/tree/master/lib/hooks/blueprints/actions.
 *
 * To override the default action that all controllers use, create an
 * api/blueprints folder and  add files to it with names matching the actions to
 * override (e.g. find.js, findone.js, create.js, etc.). You can take a look at
 * the code for the default actions in the Sails blueprints hook for a head
 * start.
